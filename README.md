# CMSLidarProcessing
Lidar processing workflow used in Hudakâ€™s CMS phase 1

These lidar scripts primarily rely on FUSION for processing. Some preprocessing might be necessary to get the data into the correct structure (e.g., the DTM format required for FUSION)

The workflow was developed using an older version of FUSION. Recent changes to FUSION might render some of these scripts decrepit. For example, applying the false easting.
